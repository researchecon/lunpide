I am currently a teaching associate at <a href="https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/" > School of Economics and Public Policy, University of Adelaide</a>. I have been tutoring data analytics, econometrics and mathematical economics. I also held a position as a visiting lecturer at the same school. Before that, I used to work as an economics research fellow at <a href="https://www.cdri.org.kh/" > Cambodia Developpment Resource Institue</a>, which is an independent research think-tank based in Cambodia. My research interests are in the fields of economic development, applied econometrics and health economics.

My PhD thesis tackles the issue of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, a region which has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world. A broad research question this thesis aims to address is why the spatial distribution of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa is so uneven. I present new evidence suggesting that the differences in the spread of the HIV pandemic in different parts of sub-Saharan Africa have deep historical roots in culture, history and geography.

<b> Paper # 1: Population Diversity, Trust, and the Transmission of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa </b>  <br>

The paper provides new evidence that population genetic diversity can mitigate the transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we exploit the fact that trade may increase HIV incidence, and demonstrate that HIV transmits more easily in countries that are more genetically homogeneous. Genetically homogeneous societies tend to be culturally homogeneous and more trusting. Thus, our results can be explained by (1) genetic and cultural homophily, as people's innate preference for genetically and culturally similar individuals as partners makes forming relationships easier in genetically and culturally homogeneous societies and (2) trust, as it may reduce one's perceived risk of contracting HIV. Our work highlights the possibility that beyond socio-economic factors, there could exist long-term structural determinants of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa that cannot be easily influenced by policies.

<b> Paper # 2: Are There Deep Determinants of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa? The Role of Geography and Slave Trade </b>  <br>

This paper shows that deep-rooted factors such as geography and history have the potential of explaining the spatial variation in HIV incidence across sub-Saharan Africa.
Specifically, we find that terrain ruggedness, a measure of the uneven topography of an area, has a robust and statistically significant effect on HIV incidence, where
more geographically rugged countries tend to have higher HIV incidence. We also observe that historical slave trade, which was prevalent in less rugged regions, could
be the mechanism driving the link between greater ruggedness and higher HIV incidence, in that once slave trade is controlled for, ruggedness loses its statistical
significance for HIV incidence. One possible explanation, which is left for future research, is that societies with higher levels of historical slave trade tend have lower
levels of trust today, and trust matters for the spread of an asymptomatic disease through sexual intercourse like HIV.
